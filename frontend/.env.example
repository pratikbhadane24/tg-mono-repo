# API Configuration
# Backend API base URL - use the URL where your backend is running
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001

# For production, set this to your actual backend URL
# Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Note: The frontend now uses cookie-based authentication
# Cookies are automatically sent with credentials: 'include' in fetch requests
# No need to store JWT tokens in localStorage anymore
